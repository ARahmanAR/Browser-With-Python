# AR Browser

AR Browser is a simple web browser built using Python and QtPy. It allows you to browse the web, open multiple tabs, and navigate back and forth through your browsing history.

## Getting Started

To run the browser, you will need Python 3.x and the PyQt5 library installed on your machine. You can install PyQt5 using pip:

pip install PyQt5


Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the browser by executing the `main.py` file:

python main.py


## Usage

AR Browser is similar to other web browsers you may have used before. Here are some key features:

- To open a new tab, click the "New Tab" button in the toolbar.
- To close a tab, click the close button on the tab or right-click the tab and select "Close Tab".
- To load a web page, enter the URL into the address bar and press Enter.
- To navigate back or forward through your browsing history, click the "<" or ">" buttons in the toolbar.
- To refresh the current page, click the "Refresh" button in the toolbar.

By default, the browser will load the Abdur Rahman homepage in each new tab. You can modify this behavior by editing the `new_tab` method in the `BrowserWindow` class.
